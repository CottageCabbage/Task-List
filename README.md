# vu-dooit
Vue + Electron Project. Supposed to be an To-do application. Making UI similar to Todoist for now, since it seems pretty simple, but try to do something different once app is somewhat-working.


> Am trying to use every feature of vue-cli (Babel, PWA Support, Router, VUEX, CSS Pre-Processors, Linter, Unit Testing, E2E Testing) here.

> Am unsure of how to do it right away, but gotta switch Vuex for Pina.

> **UI Components Libraries:** https://dev.to/roblevintennis/15-ui-component-libraries-for-vue-3-in-2022-4kl1
>> The ones called 'lightweight': https://github.com/oruga-ui/oruga https://github.com/youzan/vant https://github.com/AustinGil/Vuetensils
>>> Of these, three, only Vant is available through cdnjs, so probably use that one. Don't want to install without being sure.
