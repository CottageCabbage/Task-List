<h1 align="center">Vu-dooit</h1>
A gamified Task Manager made with Vue & Electron. Open Source, made with Electron.

Right now, making the UI similar to Todoist, since it's simple and functional. Going to try making something more unique once app is somewhat-working.

> Box-icons are being used as CDNs right now. Fix that whenever.
> Uninstall PWA Support from dependencies. Had toggled it in CLI, but don't think it'll work.
> Vuex is still installed, even though Pinia is used
