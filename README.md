# Vu-dooit
A Task Manager Desktop App made with Vue & Electron. Currently in development.

Right now, making the UI similar to Todoist, since it's simple and functional. Going to try making something more unique once app is somewhat-working.

> Element-plus & Box-Icons are currently being used as CDNs as I test them out. Remember to actually install them later if they work.

> Uninstall PWA Support from dependencies. Had toggled it in CLI, but don't think it'll work.
