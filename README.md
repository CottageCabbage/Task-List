# vu-dooit
Vue + Electron Project. Supposed to be an To-do application.

Am trying to use every feature of vue-cli (Babel, PWA Support, Router, VUEX, CSS Pre-Processors, Linter, Unit Testing, E2E Testing) here.

Am unsure of how to do it right away, but gotta switch Vuex for Pina.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Run your end-to-end tests
```
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
