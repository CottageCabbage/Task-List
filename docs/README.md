# Getting Started
These are Vu-dooit's Docs. Hopefully they'll make development a little bit easier.

## Contributing
To start contributing, first clone the repository, then run: `npm install`

After that, depending of whether you want to run the app on your browser or Electron, run either `npm run serve` or `npm run electron:serve`
