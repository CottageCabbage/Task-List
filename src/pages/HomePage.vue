<template>
  <div class="flexColumnContainer">
    I don't really know what to put here tbh. Maybe just delete it? Would have
    to do something to push route to profile/projects or something then. Can do
    that at mounted. That's a boring solution tho.
  </div>

<script>
import { defineComponent } from 'vue';

export default defineComponent({
  setup() {
    return {};
  },
});
